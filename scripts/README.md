## Data Cleaning and Processing

If you are going to modify the data cleaning and processing of our analysis, please follow this order so that the variables logic won't conflict:

  1. download_enron.R, if you need to customize your downloading of the data.
  2. Generate_users.R, **highly recommended leave it as it is**. The `users` dataframe has already contain all the essential information of the users.
  3. data_loading.R, if you need to customize the data loading pipeline.
