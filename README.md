## Introduciton

This repository contains all code and data required to reproduce our investigation on the enron mail corpus dataset. The investigation is a course project of STOR 674 Statistical and Computational Tools for Reproducible Data Science at UNC, taught by Professor Zhengwu Zhang and Dr. Jay Hineman. The main goal of this investigation is applying the tools for reproducibility in data science we learnt from the course, with a case study on the enron email corpus dataset. For this investigation, we mainly look into the social network graph of the email users and form clusters on them using various types of clustering algorithms, and analyze the clusters' stability. After that, we pick out two most stable clusters, and dig deeper into the content of the emails. Run GPT API on the text data of the emails within the clusters and do semantic analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset contains email corpus data from 150 users, mostly senoir management of Enron, organized into folders. A brief introduction can be found in the `Introducing_the_Enron_Corpus.pdf`, which is under the `\data` folder of this repository. Meanwhile, the dataset, along with a thoroough explanation of its origin, can be found at http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/.
